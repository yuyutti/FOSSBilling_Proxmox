# Proxmox module for FOSSBilling
Initial Proxmox support for FOSSBilling. 

**This module is still in development and not ready for production use.**

Based on [previous work](https://github.com/scith/BoxBilling_Proxmox) by [Scith](https://github.com/scith).

## Features
- Manage pools of Proxmox servers (orders can be allocated to servers automatically based on their capacity)
- Complete Privilege Separation (each client can only see their own VMs),
- Admin can't see inside client's VMs (Only the VM ID, Name, Status, IP, RAM, CPU, Disk, Bandwidth, etc.)
- Provision LXC containers (Doensn't Work - WIP)
- Provision QEMU KVM machines (Doensn't Work - WIP)
- Clients can start, shutdown and reboot their VMs (online console not working right now)
- Proxmox Servers do not have to be reachable from the Internet (Might need a nginx proxy manager for this, but not sure yet.)
- Rudimentary Backup of Module Data (Module data is not lost anymore when reinstalling.)


## TODOs:
- Better Error Handling when creating unexpected things happen & get returned from pve host.
- Better VM Allocation procedure
- Consistent Naming: Templates might be confusing...
- VM & LXC Template setup needs to be expanded so it can create VMs from it.
- Provisioning of VMs with Cloudinit (https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cloud-Init_Support)
- Work on Usability to configure products and manage customer's products


## Requirements
- Tested on Proxmox VE 7 or higher, PVE 6 should work too

## Installation
- Copy the "Serviceproxmox" folder in *modules*
- Make sure to chown to your web-servers User (f.ex `chown www-data:www-data Serviceproxmox -Rf`)
- Configure the Proxmox module in the FOSSBilling admin area
- Add new Proxmox servers
- "Prepare Server" on each Proxmox server (this will create the necessary API user and role) (The Plus Button in the Server List)
- Add new Proxmox products with the correct VM settings setup

The Proxmox Addon now has its own Menu Entry:
