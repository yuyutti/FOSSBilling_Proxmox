# Proxmox module for FOSSBilling

# This module is still in development and not ready for production use.

WIP Proxmox support for FOSSBilling. As stated above, this is still heavily a WIP and is not ready for production use. Please only install it if you are a developer and intend to contribute back to the module. Please see the issues (especially [#26](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/Proxmox/issues/26)) for the current status of the module as some great work is being done, but it's not yet to a complete state.

## Features
- Manage pools of Proxmox servers (orders can be allocated to servers automatically based on their capacity)
- Complete Privilege Separation (each client can only see their own VMs),
- Admin can't see inside client's VMs (Only the VM ID, Name, Status, IP, RAM, CPU, Disk, Bandwidth, etc.)
- Provision LXC containers (Doensn't Work - WIP)
- Provision QEMU KVM machines (Doensn't Work - WIP)
- Clients can start, shutdown and reboot their VMs (online console not working right now)
- Proxmox Servers do not have to be reachable from the Internet (Might need a nginx proxy manager for this, but not sure yet.)
- Rudimentary Backup of Module Data (Module data is not lost anymore when reinstalling.)


## TODOs:
- Better Error Handling when creating unexpected things happen & get returned from pve host.
- Better VM Allocation procedure
- Consistent Naming: Templates might be confusing...
- VM & LXC Template setup needs to be expanded so it can create VMs from it.
- Provisioning of VMs with Cloudinit (https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cloud-Init_Support)
- Work on Usability to configure products and manage customer's products


## Requirements
- Tested on Proxmox VE 7 or higher, PVE 6 should work too

## Installation ( For 0.1.0 Preview!)

### Prerequisites

You need to run Fossbilling 0.5.5, otherwise this preview will not work.
- Make sure you uninstall the Module first by going to Extensions -> Overview
- Then, make sure that you move the pmxconfig folder in your Fossbilling rootfolder so the new installer doesn't accidentially restore an old backup.
```mv /var/www/pmxconfig /var/www/pmxold```
- Make sure you don't have any tables beginning with service_promxox in your database anymore:
```
-- Create a stored procedure to drop tables starting with "service_proxmox" in the "client" database --

USE client; -- Set this to the database where FOSSBilling is installed

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE DropTables()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE tableName VARCHAR(255);
    DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR
        SELECT table_name
        FROM information_schema.tables
        WHERE table_schema = 'client' -- replace client with your database name
        AND table_name LIKE 'service_proxmox%';
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;
    
    OPEN cur;
    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH cur INTO tableName;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;
        SET @sql = CONCAT('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `', tableName, '`;');
        PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
        EXECUTE stmt;
        DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE cur;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;

-- Call the stored procedure to drop the tables
CALL DropTables();

-- Drop the stored procedure
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS DropTables;
```

### Installation for 0.1.0 Preview
- Go to the Modules folder (f.ex: ```cd /var/www/modules```)
- Run ```git clone https://github.com/FOSSBilling/Proxmox.git Serviceproxmox```
- Go Inside the directory ```cd Serviceproxmox/```
- Checkout the 0.1.0 branch ```git checkout 0.1.0```
- Make sure to chown to your web-servers User (f.ex `chown www-data:www-data Serviceproxmox -Rf`) 
- Install the Module in the Web interface.
- Configure the Proxmox module in the FOSSBilling admin area
- Add new Proxmox servers.
- "Prepare Server" on each Proxmox server (this will create the necessary API user and role) (The Plus Button in the Server List)
- Add new Proxmox products with the correct VM settings setup

The Proxmox Addon now has its own Menu Entry:
